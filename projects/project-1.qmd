## Overview

This project is a minimalist twist on the classic Tetris game. I used an AI assistant (Claude) to generate the necessary code for a simple, browser-based game where every falling "piece" is a single block instead of the usual four-block tetromino.

The primary purposes of this app are:

-   To create a playable browser game using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
-   To explore minimalist game design by simplifying the core mechanic of a well-known classic.
-   To practice deploying a modern web application through Vercel.

## Product Requirements Document (PRD)

This is the PRD provided to the AI assistant to generate the game's code.

### 1. Core Concept
A game like Tetris, but simplified. Instead of complex, multi-part shapes (tetrominoes), every piece that falls from the top of the screen is a single square block.

### 2. Gameplay Mechanics
-   A single block appears at the top-center of the game board and falls downwards.
-   The user can move the falling block left or right using the arrow keys.
-   The user can press the down arrow key to make the block fall faster.
-   When a block lands on the bottom of the board or on top of another block, it stops, and a new block begins to fall from the top.
-   When a horizontal row is completely filled with blocks, that row is cleared, and all blocks above it move down one row.
-   The game ends when the stack of blocks reaches the top of the board.

### 3. User Interface
-   The game will be played on a simple grid (e.g., 10 blocks wide by 20 blocks high).
-   The user's score should be displayed on the screen. The score increases every time a line is cleared.
-   A "Start Game" button is needed to begin play.
